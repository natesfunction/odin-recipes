    <p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Trim off any excess fat from the meat. Rinse a couple of times till the water runs clear.</li>
        <li>Place the beef in a large pot. Add the diced onion, bay leaf, curry powder, rosemary, bouillon powder, and salt. Mix well, cover, and leave to cook on medium heat for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the water stir and continue to cook on medium heat for another 20 minutes or until the meat becomes tender. (Tougher meat cut will require a longer cooking time)</li>
        <li>When the meat is fully cooked use a sieve to separate the meat from the stock. Reserve the stock.</li>
        <li>Blend the tomatoes, onion, bell peppers, scotch bonnet peppers, garlic, tomato paste, and ginger, and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large pot add the cooking oil on medium heat. Once the oil is hot but not smoking, add the diced onions and cook for about 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the blended pepper-tomato mixture stir, cover, and leave to cook on medium heat for about 10 minutes, occasionally stirring to prevent burning.</li>
        <li>Stir in the beef stock, thyme, curry powder, and bouillon, and continue to cook for another 10 minutes on medium-low heat.</li>
        <li>Add the cooked beef, taste for salt, and adjust as needed. Cover and leave to simmer on low heat for another 5 minutes or until the stew is thickened to your preference.</li>
        <li>Serve with white rice and fried plantains. Garnish with parsley if desired. Enjoy!</li>
