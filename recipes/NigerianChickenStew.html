        <li>1½- 2 Cups Chicken Stock</li>
        <li>1 Tsp Curry Powder</li>
        <li>1 Tsp Rosemary</li>
        <li>1 tsp Paprika</li>
        <li>2 bay leaves</li>
        <li>2 Tsp chicken bouillon powder or 2 Chicken cubes</li>
        <li>1/4 cup olive oil or vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 tbsp tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 to 1½ cups Chicken stock I used the liquid from cooking the Chicken</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Curry powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon chicken bouillon or Chicken bouillon</li>
        <li>Salt to taste If needed</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Slice the tomatoes, peppers, and onions into two halves and place them in a sheet pan alongside the garlic cloves. Brush generously with oil and place in a 425F preheated oven and roast for 30 minutes or till slightly charred. Blend everything with the ginger root and set aside.</li>
        <li>Season the chicken with paprika, thyme, curry powder, salt, and pepper. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet, heat oil over medium heat, add 2 tbsp from the diced onions, and cook till the oil becomes fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken legs and fry until they become well browned on both sides—about 10 minutes on each side. Remove from pan and set aside.</li>
        <li>Add the remaining diced onions inside the same pan where the chicken was fried. Cook till the onions become translucent. Add the blended sauce and bay leaves and cook for 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken broth, paprika, curry powder, rosemary, bouillon powder, black pepper, and salt to taste.</li>
        <li>Gently put the fried chicken in the sauce and leave to simmer until the chicken becomes tender about 20 minutes – a little more or less depending on how big your chicken is.</li>
        <li>Stir occasionally to prevent burning and adjust the thickness of stew with water or stock if necessary.</li>
        <li>Serve over white rice, pasta, couscous, or eat with freshly baked bread.</li>
    </ol>
